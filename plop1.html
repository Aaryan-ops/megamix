    <li>Being superior to your former self.A proud man is always looking down on things and people. As long as you are looking down, you cannot see something that is above you.</li>
    <li>Once we accept our limits, we go beyond them. Formal education will make you a living, self-education will make you a fortune.</li>
    <li>We you see someone not so good, reflect on your own weak points, when you see a good person, think of your good points.</li>
    <li>When I accept myself just as I am, then I can change.</li>
    <li>I do not believe in taking the right decision. I take a decision and make it right. There is only one corser of the univere you can be certain of improving, and this is your own self.</li>
    <li>Habit is what gets you started, motivation is what keeps you going. Mind and muscle, exercise them more to make them stronger.</li>
    <li>Whenever I will be in a difficult situation where there seems to be no way out, I will think about all the times I have been in such situations, and say to myself <q>I did it before, so I can do it again. </q></li>
    <li>The type of person you are is reflected in your business. To improve your busi-ness, improve yourself. Be wiser than other people, but do not tell them so. Success comes from the inside out.</li>
    <li>When you work on something that only has the capacity to make you 5 dollars, it does not matter how much harder you work - the most you will make is 5 dollars.</li>
    <li>Every evening before falling asleep, recall to your mind the events of the whole day, and consider exactuly what has been good and bad. Then, you will realize improving yourself at the start of each new day.</li>
    <li>What is considered impossible is someone else's opinion. What is possible is my decision. The things that determine the quality of your mind are what you think about.</li>
    <li>Ability takes hard work. You only grow when you are alone. Man cannot remake himself without suffering, for he is both the marble and the sculptor. He who conquers himself is the mightiest warrior.</li>
    <li>Internet connects by making isolations. We are consistently what we want to become each day, because we want to become what we want.</li>
    <li>No matter whether you believe in luck or chance, the final decision is from yourself. If you can see yourself as an artist, and you can see that your life is your own creation, then why not create the most beautiful story for yourself?</li>
    <li>Our greatness lies in being able to remake ourselves, not the world. Everything is practice. The things I carry are my thoughts. That is it. They are the only weight. My thoughts determine whether I am free and light or burdened.</li>
    <li>Things do not grow better. They remain as they are. It is we who grow better, by the changes we make in ourselves. Where we fall are the stepping-stones for out journey.</li>
    <li>A person today who has a greate sense of self-esteem has his chidlhood days to thank for it. A good self-esteem level is mostly dependant on how we value ourselves without any bias.</li>
