  <li>Whatever the mind can conceive and believe, it can achieve. The freedom to do your best means nothing unless you are willing to do your best.</li>
  <li>Small shifts in your thinking and small changes in your energy can lead to massive alterations of your end result.The ultimate reward is the path itself.</li>
  <li>People pretend not to like grapes when the vines are too high for them to reach. <h1>SO DON'T SAY THAT YOU DO NOT CARE TO ATTEMPT THE ASSIGNMENTS. SAY THAT YOU COULD NOT DO THEM, MANAGE TO DO THEM. THIS WAY YOU WILL ACCEPT AND AT LEAST TRY THEM THERE.</h1>h1></li>
  <li>Stop cheering for others who are living their visions. Commit yourself to your own success and follow the steps required to achieve it. Beware of those who criticize you when you deserve some praise for a achievement, for it is they who secretly desire to be worshipped. Only the impossible is worth doing.</li>
  <li>Success in life is not for those who run fast, but for thoe who keep running and are always on the move.</li>
  <li>Loveless work, boring work, work valued only because others havent got even that much, however loveless and boring--this is one of the harshest human miseries.If in trouble, focus on where you want to be, rather than where you are. </li>
  <li>The goal is the journey done well. No matter what you achieve, the end feels like a movie watched in the distant past. Achievement requires 3 things, believe that you are going to get it (declare), focus on how you are going to get it, motivation that makes yu reach at the destination.</li>
  <li>Estimation is a key. Don't overetimate  the effort, and don't underestimate your capacity.We fail to acheve big things because we have neglected enlarging and increasing out inner capacity to handle and accommodate the successs we are desiring in our lives. Any achievement is directly proportionate to the inner capacity to handle it.</li></ol><img src="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/d8/1d/20/d81d2007a8fb7c1924709ed6bdb539ce.gif" alt="plop3"><img src="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/b9/a9/dd/b9a9dd7817b848dfaeebc79a54efe10b.gif" alt="plop3"><img src="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/33/b6/7b/33b67b8c89c393c835f675e66c1dc4c5.gif" alt="plop3"><img src="https://static1.e621.net/data/9c/ea/9ceac01932dd0cfe8d9abb0653fb35e9.gif" alt="plop3"><img src="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/0c/b7/93/0cb793affcee3075ad83f73290b4638b.gif" alt="plop3">
